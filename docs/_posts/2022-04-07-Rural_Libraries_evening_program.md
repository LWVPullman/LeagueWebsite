Coordinator: Alice Schroeder

As part of our current local Library Update Study, there will be a general meeting Thursday, April 7, 2022 from 7:00 to 9:00pm on Zoom. Three speakers will join us: Dan Owens from Neill Public Library, Sheri Miller, interim director, Whitman County Library, and Lorena O’English from WSU Libraries. The speakers from Neill and Whitman County Libraries will update us on current status, funding and future hopes and plans for their libraries, while Ms. O’English will give us a broader view of rural libraries, their funding and challenges. There will be ample opportunity for questions from viewers.


The public is invited to attend over Zoom.
