# Library Consensus & State Program Planning Meeting

Coordinators:  Alice Schroeder, Paul Spencer, Tricia Granthem 

WE NEED YOUR IDEAS!

LIBRARY CONSENSUS:

Please join the League of Women Voters Pullman as we answer Library Study Consensus questions. Your
input will enable us to develop stronger positions to advocate for Neill Public Library &amp; the Whitman
County Libraries. *The Library Study and consensus questions will be e-mailed to all members the first
week of January. The Study should take no more than an hour to read.  We encourage all members to read through the study and come discuss it to help formulate new positions.

Following the consensus meeting, you will have a great opportunity to learn more about and give suggestions for State League
projects and studies. We will be generating ideas for advocacy and actions for our local League and for
submission to the State Convention in May.
