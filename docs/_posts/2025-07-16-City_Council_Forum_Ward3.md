**Pullman City Council Positions Ward 3 Cadidate Forum**

Coordinator: Deb Olson 

Program Description:

The League of Women Voters of Pullman and Whitman County held two primary candidate forums for Pullman City Council Positions in Ward 1 (July 15) and Ward 3 (July 16).  There are only 2 candidates for Ward 2 and they will advance automatically to the General Election.

The Ward 3 forum was on Tuesday, July 16th from 5:30 to 7 pm at Neill Public Library. The candidates for Ward 3 were John Casselman, V Shae Ortega, and Tawny Szumlas. Karl Olsen, Federico C. Bartolo, Dave Gibney, and Colin Bannister could not attend. 

Due to the large candidate pool, questions for the forum were solicited from the public ahead of time. The forum was available live on zoom and recorded for later viewing.

Please note you can only vote for the candidates in your Ward. [What Council Ward Am I In?](https://gis.pullman-wa.gov/portal/apps/instant/lookup/index.html?appid=81968c2f279249308509b19375715336)
