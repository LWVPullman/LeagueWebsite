## Cody Finch

I was born and raised in Whitman County, attending Pullman High School and WSU for Economics. I am the 5th generation who has lived and worked on our family farm and ranch and I have no plans to ever leave. I want to see the county be a safe and thriving place for my kids, in hopes that they stick around for generations to come. Farming and the communities that support them will always be present in Whitman County, but the quality of life here is being gradually diminished. I want to help change that, I want business and opportunity to thrive, I want a community that is moving in a positive direction, and I think I have some ideas and the resolve to make a difference. My wife Brandy and I have three kids Mason (13), Hailey (9), and Cash (1).

## Chad Whetzel

Education:  I graduated from Washington State University with a Bachelor of Science in Animal Science in 1997.  

Professional Experience:  Since 1997, I have operated a successful farrier business.  

Community Service:  For 25 years I was a 4-H leader and council member.  In 1999, I joined Whitman County Fire District 12. I have served as an EMT for 24 years and a Captain for 14 years.  I was a Whitman County Planning Commission member for 12 years and chair for 8 years. I have also been a member of the Whitman County Cattlemen’s Association and the Washington State Cattlemen's Association for 10 years.

Statement:  I believe my service on the planning commission gives me invaluable insight into the challenges facing our county.  Years of volunteer service has allowed me to work with many diverse groups throughout Whitman County.  As a farrier I have been able to travel all of our county.  I believe my experience in leadership, will help move Whitman County successfully into the future, by balancing responsible growth and preserving our rural heritage.  My success as a small business owner will guide me when balancing budgets.
