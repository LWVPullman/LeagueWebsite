# Cookie Exchange and Monthly Board Meeting

Coordinators: Tricia Grantham and Kat Odell

Join us for our December board meeting where we’ll take care of business and enjoy a festive cookie exchange. Bring a plate of your favorite treats to share—homemade or store-bought, all are welcome!

Let’s wrap up the year with good company, good conversation, and very good cookies. 

Saturday, Dec 13th, at 9:30-11:30 am.   All Members will be emailed meeting location.  

We have a “Board of the Whole” so all members are encouraged to attend. Please look for an email sent to members prior to each board meeting. If you are not a member and would like to attend as a guest please email for more information. LWVPull@yahoo.com
