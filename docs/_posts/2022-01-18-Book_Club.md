Book:  “The Library Book” by Susan Orlean

Coordinator: Anne Lewis

Please join me at noon on Tuesday, January 18 for the League of Women Voters of Pullman's Brown Bag discussion of Susan Orlean's The Library Book.  The zoom link will be provided a few days before the event.

Please come even if you have not read the book in full (or at all).  There is much discussion that can be had about unsolved mysteries, captivating librarians and civic leaders, and the value of libraries in our society and personal lives.

Check out the following link for some interesting (and, yes, dated) videos and material related to the Los Angeles Central Library fire and rebuilding.  I find myself fascinated that the Chairman of the Board of ARCO- Lodwrick "Lod" Cook-- was a huge supporter/the face of the fundraising efforts.
