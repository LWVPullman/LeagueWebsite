Program:  Dr. Brian French is committed to helping young people overcome challenges, achieve their potential, and live happier lives. Psychometrics, statistics, and measurements are the instruments through which French accomplishes these goals. French followed this research track as an undergraduate at Seattle University. Then, while conducting psychology experiments in graduate school at Purdue University, he unexpectedly discovered a passion for educational and psychological measurement. As director of Washington State University’s Learning and Performance Research Center (LPRC), Dr. French and his team create assessments that use a strength-based approach, rather than punitive, to help young people move forward in a positive way.

Dr. French will present about Washington Assessment of the Risks and Needs of Students (WARNS) project which is a key assessment tool to create intervention plans based on concrete information. WARNS is an evidence-based assessment for middle and high school students. It examines youth experiences in six domains critical for healthy social, emotional, and educational development. The results help schools and youth service providers determine individual needs, in order to target interventions accordingly.
