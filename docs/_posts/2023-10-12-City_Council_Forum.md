#  Pullman Voter Forum - Candidates for City Council

Coordinators: Deborah Olson

Program Description:  
The Pullman League of Women voters in partnership with Neill Public Library will present three candidate forums. All three forums will be held at Neill Public Library and begin at the stated times. The Forums will also be on zoom (see link below) and will be recorded. Questions will not be accepted over Zoom but may be emailed to [lwvpull@yahoo.com](mailto:lwvpull@yahoo.com) before the forums.

On October 12 from 6:30 to 8 pm candidates for city council. The candidates for Ward 1 are Ann Parks (incumbent) and Dan Maher, for Ward 3 Pat Wright (incumbent) and CJ Robert, and for the vacant at large position Eric Fejeran and Holly Greystone. Every one in the city can vote for the at large position but only people who live within Ward 1 and Ward 3 can vote in these races.
