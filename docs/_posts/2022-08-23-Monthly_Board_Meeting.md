# Monthly Board Meetings


Board meetings are open to all League members and are held on the 4th Tuesday of each month at 11:00 am – 1:00 pm.     August – May.  Although we prefer to meet in person, meetings will be over Zoom for the foreseeable future.

We have a “Board of the Whole” so all members are welcome to attend.  Members are emailed the Zoom meeting link. 

If you are not a member but would like to attend, contact the league by [email](mailto:lwvpull@yahoo.com) to request the link to attend as a guest.
