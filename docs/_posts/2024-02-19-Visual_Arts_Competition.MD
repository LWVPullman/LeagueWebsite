## Why Does Voting Matter?

Voting is the most basic act of citizenship. YOU are a future Voter!  What MATTERS to you?  Who has the right to VOTE? The right to vote didn’t come easy for everyone.  Join us in exploring the history of voting rights, how the voting process works, and how every vote matters.

**Purpose:**

This Art Competition is for students in grades 3-12 to share their artistic talent in portraying why voting matters.
