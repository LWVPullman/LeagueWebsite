## Hannah Martian (Candidate for Pullman School District 4)

Howdy! I’m Hannah, a proud two-time graduate of WSU currently pursuing my PhD in education, and an active member of the Pullman community. Currently, I work at the Neill Public Library as the Youth Services Assistant and as a Substitute Teacher in the Pullman School District. I’ve been grateful to get to spend time with so many educators, students, families, and community members in my roles. I’m running to be a member of the school board because public education affects all of us. It’s in part because of invested community members who served on my local school board that I received a well-rounded, evidence-based K-12 education. As someone who has lived in Pullman on and off for nine years, I care deeply about this community and the future generations that will inherit it. I am vehemently anti-censorship, and am ready to combat the rampant misinformation surrounding our education system. I can promise that I’ll always show up for Pullman families, especially when hard choices must be made. I’m not interested in playing politics or getting an ego boost from this position; instead, I offer a caring, thoughtful, unbiased viewpoint to the community that has offered so much to me.

Elected Experience: Associated Students of Washington State University, College of Education Senator and Senate Pro Tempore; Graduate and Professional Students Association, College of Education Senator.

Professional/Work Experience: Neill Public Library, Youth Services Assistant; Pullman School District, Substitute Teacher; Teaching Assistant, WSU. 

Education: BA & MA in sport management (WSU, ‘20 & ‘24), PhD in education (WSU, current).

Community Service: Pullman Parks and Recreation, Coach; WSU Community Standards Board, Chair; The Trevor Project, Youth Helpline Operator.

## Deena Bayoumi (Candidate for Pullman School District 4) 

Deena Bayoumi is a dedicated parent of two sons and long-time community member, having attended Pullman Schools and returned to the area in 2014. With a background in public policy and non-profit management, she is dedicated to public service. She has worked for Community Action Center since 2022 coordinating food distribution to rural residents with the Mobile Farm Stand.  Prior to that, she served as the Director of the Education Committee for the LWV of the Charleston Area, eventually taking on the role of Education Advocacy Specialist for the LWV of South Carolina.  While completing her MPA, she briefly worked at the Center for Education Policy and Practice at the National Education Association in Washington, DC and served as a Policy Specialist for the Superintendent of Schools for Charleston County School District.  

Since returning to Pullman, she has continued her efforts in advocating for equitable resources and education for under-represented students in Pullman School District. She currently holds the role of Board Secretary for Palouse EDJE, and has volunteered for Pullman School Pantry, Intersectional Advocacy Coalition, and Elementary Parent Representative on PSD Calendar Committee.  She was also part of a group of residents that helped establish the District’s DEIB Task Force last year.  

As an actively engaged parent, she believes that the school board should be representative of Pullman and should strive to serve in trust for the community and not just be a rubber stamp for anything the superintendent recommends or requests.  This means being responsive to the interests of students and families, teachers, and staff while ensuring that the superintendent is held accountable to the board for achieving those goals.  If elected, she will proactively work to connect with different constituencies, actively engaging in solutions and ensuring that every voice is heard. 

## Stephanie Horn (Candidate for Pullman School District 5)

Stephanie has lived in Pullman since 1992 when she moved here to attend WSU. She earned her degree in Child, Consumer, and Family Studies and Elementary Education. Along with her husband, Eric, they have raised four children here. Stephanie began teaching in the Pullman School District in 2011 after she was fortunate enough to stay home while the kids were young. She has taught at three of the four elementary schools in Pullman. She was active in the PTA, Pullman Education Association leadership, and served on several building intervention and leadership teams while employed with the district. After leaving the school district in 2021, she took a job with WSU’s College of Education where she is currently a field supervisor and has taught future teachers. She also tutors children in the community through the year.

## Brandon Kruger (Candidate for Pullman School District 5)

I am a parent of two students in the Pullman School District; a daughter entering 5th grade and a son entering 2nd grade.  I have volunteered for their classes when they get to go on field trips and participated in field day events as well. I have a deep appreciation for our Pullman educational staff and the work they do to provide opportunities for our students. I have also volunteered as a softball coach at Pullman High School and for the Athletic Department as a football announcer and helped with other game management tasks for my wife who was the Athletics & Activities Director. I have also been a volunteer coach for Pullman Parks and Rec. as well as the Pullman Youth Baseball Association. I have over thirteen years of experience working in public works; much of that time as a heavy equipment operator but also as the maintenance coordinator for five years. Both roles gave me ample opportunity to interface directly with members of the public. As the maintenance coordinator, I supervised over 45 employees, conducted interviews, oversaw the maintenance budget, was in charge of fleet management and equipment purchasing. I commonly interacted with the Board of County Commissioners and other county officials in the course of my work. I have also been a part of the local agricultural community driving truck and combine during harvest and helping with spring and fall work as needed.  I am connected to many of our community members through our family’s involvement in many aspects of Pullman and I believe that my well-rounded professional experience has prepared me to serve our community if elected as a school board member.
