The LWV of Pullman Annual Business Meeting addressed issues that are important to you, our community, and to ways to make democracy work.  We must have a quorum of no less than 18 members attending to vote on business matters and we had 25 in attendance at this meeting.  We took a look back at activities and accomplishments during the last year with a presentation given by our president, Bobby Ryder.
