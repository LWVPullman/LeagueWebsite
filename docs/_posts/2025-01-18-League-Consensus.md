# League Consensus Meeting

# Elder Care and Immigration Studies

Program Coordinator: Tricia Grantham and Sutton Mooney

Date:  Saturday, January 18, 10 am

Location:  Neill's Coffee House in donwtown Pullman

Program:  Elder Caregiving Study has been posted on the League of Women Voters of Washington website, lwvwa.org. In SEARCH, type in Elder Caregiving to bring up the information mentioned below.

In addition to the study, you will also find the Consensus Questions & a way to register for informational sessions held @ 1:30 or 6:30 on TUESDAY, JANUARY 7, 2025, via Zoom. Both sessions will be recorded if you cannot attend on the 7th.

This presentation will be a great opportunity to prepare for our League's Consensus meeting scheduled for SATURDAY, JANUARY 18TH at 10:00, Neill's Coffee & Ice Cream. I think the questions will generate an important conversation!
