Use the following code and just changes the image name.
Go to the assets file and the images file and add the image there. 

! [image name]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/name_of_image.jpeg "Alt text goes here"){: .align-center}

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/flag.png "A picture of a flag"){: .align-center}

The image above happens to be **centered**.

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LWV.jpeg "League of Women Voters Badge"){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for an image with **no alignment**.

![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/league.jpeg "League Image")

The image above, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/meeting.jpg){: .align-right}

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image.
