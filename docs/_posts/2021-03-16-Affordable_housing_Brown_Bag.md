# Affordable Housing on the Palouse

The Palouse Regional Housing Assessment and Affordable Housing
Brian Points, President of Points Consulting in Moscow, was the guest speaker at the League of Women Voters of Pullman Brown Bag meeting on March 16th at noon.  He is both a management consultant and economist who collects information, data, and past experiences and translates them into meaningful change.  An advocate of small, single family homes built on smaller lots and in greater density, Points will present the Palouse Regional Housing Study which was published in September of 2019.
