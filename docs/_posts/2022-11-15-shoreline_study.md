# LWVWA Shoreline Study Presentation

Coordinators: Deb Olson and Susan Daniels

BrownBag Lunch, Tuesday, November 15, at noon over Zoom
 
Shoreline Management Act:
 
Fifty plus years ago Washington passed the Shoreline Management Act (SMA), one of the first environmental laws in the state. It covers virtually all the shorelines of our state, including rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. In 2022 the LWV of Washington made a study to analyze how effective the SMA has been. This meeting will present their findings about its effectiveness, how it has benefitted our shorelines, and issues that impact its application and effectiveness.
