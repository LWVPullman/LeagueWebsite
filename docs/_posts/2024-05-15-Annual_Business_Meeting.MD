May 15, 2024 from 6:00-8:00 pm at the Pullman Depot Heritage Center

All members of the Pullman League are cordially invited to our Annual Business Meeting. It is very important that you attend if possible as a quorum of 18 is required. 

We will meet in the Main Waiting Room of the Pullman Depot Heritage Center on Wednesday, May 15th from 6-8 pm. We will focus on next year's Budget, Officers, and Bylaws and review some successes from the last year. Please join us with your presence, thoughts, and salads for a potluck! All salads are welcome (i.e. potato, fruit, green bean, Jello, dessert, lettuce, tabouli, or whatever you consider a salad.) Salads come in all shapes and sizes, including charcuterie boards.
