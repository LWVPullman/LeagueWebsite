The GF Coop Board has been working toward this end and toward establishing a coop store. Join the League of Women Voters of Pullman to hear a presentation by Kathleen Ryan and Sue Guyett about what has been happening and steps going forward. This event will be over Zoom on Thursday, September 2nd as the feature of the “Back to League” meeting. The Zoom link can be found on lwvpullman.org.
