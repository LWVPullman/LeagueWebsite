# An Evening with Rob Curley
## The Virtuous Circle: Teaching a community how to be a community


In an era when both small towns and newspapers are struggling, what happens when a local paper leads a community-wide effort to embrace the idea of a “virtuous circle” — that a region can grow in innumerable ways when it works together for the positive? The results were off-the-charts. Then COVID 19 changed everything. Spokesman-Review editor Rob Curley will explain how Spokane’s oldest and largest news organization continues to show how leadership during difficult times can feed more than just a bottom line, it can reenergize a hometown.
