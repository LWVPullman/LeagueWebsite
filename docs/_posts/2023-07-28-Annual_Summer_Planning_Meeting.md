Program Description: The LWV of Pullman Annual Summer Planning Meeting is the all-members annual meeting where we will discuss the topics for our general evening meetings and Brown Bag Lunch meetings for the coming year. This is the time members can share ideas that are important to them, our community, and come up with ways to make democracy work. The business meeting will run from 10 am to noon, followed with time to relax and socialize during the salad potluck. Members will receive an email with meeting details.
