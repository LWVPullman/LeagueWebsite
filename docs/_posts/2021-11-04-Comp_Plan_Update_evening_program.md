Speakers: City of Pullman and Whitman County Planners

Coordinator: Shelly Fox and Jessica Castleman

There are two Comprehensive Plan Updates underway in 2021. The City of Pullman and Whitman County are both working with teams of planners and engineers to re-write documents that look to the future for their jurisdictions. The comprehensive plan is the guiding document for all zoning codes and covers land use, transportation, public services, economic development, parks, trails, recreation facilities and utilities. A presentation by the planners will summarize these important plans and the process that is being followed.

The Comprehensive Plans can be found on the Whitman County and City of Pullman websites:
