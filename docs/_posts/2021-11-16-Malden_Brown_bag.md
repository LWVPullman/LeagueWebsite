Speaker:  Malden Mayor Dan Harwood 

Coordinator: Bobbie Ryder

On Labor Day weekend, Malden, WA, was devastated when the Babb Road fire destroyed more than 120 or 80% of the homes in the town of roughly 200 people. The fire started when a tree fell onto power lines.  One year later, the town continues to show resilience.  Mayor Dan Harwood spoke over zoom for the Brown Bag on November 16th at noon.

Funds to help rebuild Malden are  being collected by the Pine Creek Community Recovery Long Term Recovery Organization (PCCRLTRO).  For more information call 509-508-9806 or email: PCCRLTRO@gmail.com
