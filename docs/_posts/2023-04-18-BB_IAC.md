# Intersectional Advocacy Coalition of Whitman County 

Speakers: Diana Whitney, Lesli McGowan & Deena Bayoumi

Coordinators: Tricia Grantham

Program Description: 

Learn about the INTERSECTIONAL COALITION ADVOCACY of WHITMAN COUNTY (IAC), a new grassroots organization dedicated to making positive, sustainable change in the lives of underserved residents. Their mission is to “champion social justice and human rights by harnessing the collective power of groups and individuals.” We will also hear about future plans that include organizing a community-wide Social Justice Festival. Though new, IAC is already becoming a source of support whenever there are human rights injustices in our community.
 
Our guest speakers are the co-founders Diana Whitney, Lesli McGowan & Deena Bayoumi.
