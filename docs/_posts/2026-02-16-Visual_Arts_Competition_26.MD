<span style="color:green; font-size:2em;"> **90% Happens Locally** </span>

## Between state, county, and city governments, most of the decisions that affect your daily lives happen close to home. This year’s competition highlights the power of our voices, our votes, and our actions to create change in our own communities.

**Purpose:**
This art competition invites students in grades 3–12 living in Whitman County to showcase their artistic talents while learning about local government.  The LWV is a nonpartisan organization, and, as part of our civics education program this year, we want to encourage students to explore how local government shapes daily life and imagine the change they can create close to home.

**Eligibility:**

2.	Participant must be a resident of Whitman County.
3.	Participant must fill out an entry form completely with a parent/legal guardian signature and physical copy of artwork turned in.

5.	2-Dimensional artwork is not to exceed the size of 11 x 17 inches.  3-Dimensional artwork is not to exceed 1 cubic foot.
6.	No names, including the artist or artwork title, are to appear on the front of the completed artwork.
