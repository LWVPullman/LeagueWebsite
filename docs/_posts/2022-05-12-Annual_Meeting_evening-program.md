At the LWV of Pullman Annual Business Meeting we address issues that are important to you, our community, and ways to make democracy work. We must have a quorum of no less than 18 members attending to vote on business matters. We will take a look back at activities and accomplishments during the last year with a presentation given by our president, Bobby Ryder.

Members are encouraged to invite friends who may be interested in attending to learn more about the league.
