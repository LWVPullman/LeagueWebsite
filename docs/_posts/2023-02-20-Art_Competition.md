## Civics and the natural world are connected:  How does this affect your future?

We think of our government as being “of the people, by the people, for the people.” But government is also for the birds, bees, bears, and beavers. They can’t vote, but their homes, families, and futures depend on what governments do or don’t do. In fact, the whole web of life is affected by decisions our elected leaders and government agencies make.  We govern all the land we walk on, the air we breathe every day, and every drop of water. Decisions our local, state, tribal, and federal governments make affect every forest, every mountain, and every lake and river.
