# Tribal Sovereignty 

Speakers:  Neoshia R. Roemer

Coordinators: Lennis Boyer

The Pullman LWV is committed to civics education including issues involving Native American sovereignty and the impact of recent and ongoing Supreme Court decisions on tribal issues.  For this reason we have invited Professor Neoshia Roemer to address these issues.  

Professor Roemer is an Assistant Professor at the University of Idaho College of Law where she teaches family law. Her areas of interest include domestic violence, child welfare, LGBTQ issues, and the Indian Child Welfare Act.   Prior to joining the faculty at Idaho, Neoshia worked as the Fellow and, later, Staff Attorney for the Indigenous Law & Policy Center at the Michigan State University College of Law.  There, she mentored first year American Indian law students, worked on appellate litigation involving the Indian Child Welfare Act, and coached moot court among various other tasks. 
 
Professor Roemer will present “Indian Law in 2023” during a Zoom presentation on February 2 at 7 PM.  She will highlight basics about Indian law and some ongoing issues, including the Indian Child Welfare Act.
