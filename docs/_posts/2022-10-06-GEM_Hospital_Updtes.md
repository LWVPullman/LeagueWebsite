  # Pullman Regional Hospital Updates
  Speaker: Scott Adams/Matt Forge/Dr. Ed Tingstad
  
  Coordinator: Tricia Grantham
  
  Come learn about plans for expanding patient care at Pullman Regional Hospital. Have your questions answered about the proposed $27.5 million bond on November’s ballot to help fund a $45 million project. It will serve to create much needed additional space in order to address the growing health care needs of our community.
 
Join us on Thursday, October 6th, at 7:00 PM at the Gladish Community & Cultural Center View Room, 3rd Floor.  A panel of speakers consisting of hospital leaders and physician volunteers, active with the Citizens for Pullman Regional Hospital, will be available to provide information and answer questions.
 
This event is sponsored by the League of Women Voters Pullman, the members of the Philanthropic Education Organization (P.E.O. Chapter FZ) and the Care Committee. All are welcome!
