  # Pullman Regional Hospital Updates
  
  Speakers: Scott Adams, Matt Forge, and Dr. Stephanie Fosback
  
  Coordinator: Tricia Grantham
  
  WE learned about plans for expanding patient care at Pullman Regional Hospital. Questions were answered about the proposed $27.5 million bond on November’s ballot to help fund a $45 million project. It was said to create much needed additional space in order to address the growing health care needs of our community.
 
This event was on Thursday, October 6th, at 7:00 PM at the Gladish Community & Cultural Center View Room, 3rd Floor.  The panel of speakers consisted of hospital leaders and physician volunteers, active with the Citizens for Pullman Regional Hospital, was be available to provide information and answer questions.
 
This event was sponsored by the League of Women Voters Pullman, the members of the Philanthropic Education Organization (P.E.O. Chapter FZ) and the Care Committee.
