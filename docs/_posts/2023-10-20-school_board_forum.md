#  Pullman Voter Forum - Candidates for School Board

Coordinators: Deborah Olson

Program Description:  
The Pullman League of Women voters in partnership with Neill Public Library presented three candidate forums. All three forums were held at Neill Public Library. The Forums were also on Zoom and were recorded.

On Friday, October 20, 2023, the candidates for District 3 of School Board met. The two candidates for this position are James Evermann (incumbent) and Craig Nelson. 

Ballots will be mailed on October 20. Please remember to sign your ballot. Ballots must be postmarked by 8 pm on November 7 or placed in one of four dropbox locations: on Paradise Street, in the Rosauers parking lot, on WSU outside the CUB, and WSU Chinook Student Center.

If you haven't registered to vote there is still time. You can register by mail or online (votewa.gov) until October 30. You can register and vote on Election Day at official polling places, the election office in Colfax and the HUB (Ballroom of WSU CUB). Both locations have handicap accessible voting.
