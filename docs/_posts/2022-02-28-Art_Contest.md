What Does Democracy Look Like to You?  Celebrating Democracy is the theme for this visual arts contest held by the LWV of Pullman (Whitman County) as part of their civics education program.  It is open to students ages 8-18 living in Whitman County.  Students are asked to use their artistic talents to portray what Democracy looks like to them.  The contest is being held to encourage understanding of and participation in government.  The best seven submissions will receive $50 in gift certificates to local businesses and a copy of the LWVWA civics textbook The State We’re In: Washington.  Launched on President’s Day, Feb 21, 2022, contest entries will be accepted throughout the month of March.  The rules and more information can be found on the website LWVPullman.org, and on the league’s Instagram and Facebook pages.
