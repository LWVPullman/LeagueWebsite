Speaker: Sue Durrant

Coordinator: Libby Walker

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was passed by Congress 50 years ago.  It prohibits sex discrimination in any school or other education program that receives funding from the federal government. Professor Sue Durrant of WSU, one of the plaintiffs in the Blair vs WSU lawsuit (1987) which focused on gender discrimination in athletics, will share her reflections on this important case which was based on the Washington State Equal Right Amendment and the Washington State Law Against Discrimination.

The League of Women Voters would like to invite the public to attend this Brown Bag Lunch on February 15, 2022, at noon via Zoom.
