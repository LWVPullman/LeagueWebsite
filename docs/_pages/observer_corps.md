The League of Women Voters of Pullman has an invaluable tool in its mission of working for good government when there is a vigorous and lively Observer Corps in place. This group forms the eyes and ears of the LWVP Board as members attend and observe the workings of governmental bodies. “The League's reputation as a civic monitor has been earned by the Observer Corps of the local Leagues.”

## What is the Observer Corps and what is its function within the League?
Observer Corps members attend council, board, commission, and advisory committees to listen, learn, observe, and report back to the League with factual information about the proceedings and any information about which the Board may be interested. In particular, the Observer calls the League Board’s attention to community and public policy issues that the League may wish to act/testify on based on League Position Statements. Observers also identify trends or problems for possible future study and action by the League.
