Posted on May 9, 2012

this is a new post about league activities

It really doesn't matter what I put here.

Yeah, horrible pictures. I’ll work on that. At any rate, it’s a really great advertisement in that it’s fun and makes people smile as they walk by. But also horrible because I don’t remember who the advertisement was for. Not that you can read it in my pictures. But it’s a great idea for getting people to notice your ad when they’re in a hurry and not really paying attention to the ads on the walls.

Pretty awesome.

Until next time!
