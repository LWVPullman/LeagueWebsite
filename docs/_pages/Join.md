People join the League of Women Voters for many reasons-- voter service, studies, education, public forums. What is your passion?

The League of Women Voters is a nonpartisan grassroots political organization open to both women and men.

It encourages informed and active participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.  The LWV neither supports nor opposes any political party or candidate for elective office, but it does encourage its members as individuals to take part fully in the political process.   For more details, go to League Basics.
