League of Women Voters members are passionate activists who support our work in all 50 states and in more than 700 communities.

Joining the LWV is a great way to get involved in your community and play an active role in our democracy.

The LWV is a nonpartisan grassroots political organization open to both women and men at least 16 years of age.

The LWV encourages informed and active participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.  The LWV neither supports nor opposes any political party or candidate for elective office, but it does encourage its members as individuals to take part in the political process.

People join the League of Women Voters for many reasons-- voter service, studies, education, public forums. What is your passion?
