League of Women Voters members are passionate activists who support our work in all 50 states and in more than 700 communities.

Joining the LWV of Pullman/Whitman County is a great way to get involved in your community and play an active role in our democracy.

The LWV is a nonpartisan grassroots political organization open to both women and men at least 16 years of age.

The LWV encourages informed and active participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.  The LWV neither supports nor opposes any political party or candidate for elective office, but it does encourage its members as individuals to take part in the political process.

People join the League of Women Voters for many reasons-- voter service, studies, education, public forums. What is your passion?

All members are invited to fill out an [Experience and Interests Survey](https://lwvpullman.org/assets/PDFs/2022-09-Experience_Interests_Survey.pdf) for volunteering opportunities.

Please note a new membership payment system was implemented by the National LWV as of Feb. 3, 2025. [This video](https://vimeo.com/1046821379/ac6c340f06?share=copy) will walk you through how to complete the membership form to join or renew your membership with the LWV.

Membership dues are split between the local League of Women Voters Pullman/Whitman County (20%), LWV of Washington (47%), and LWVUS (33%). Dues are paid annually.  The recommended annual membership dues are $75.  You may choose any amount as low as $20 and paying more than the recommended amount helps support members who contribute less while keeping our budget balanced, but it does not come with additional benefits.
