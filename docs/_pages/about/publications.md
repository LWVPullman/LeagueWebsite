The Pullman League of Women voters can frequently be found in the news! We do a lot of work in the community, so we pop up in the local newspaper and the Community Update. Also, the Pullman League releases our own newsletter quarterly. All of those items can be found linked below!

The League is frequently in the [Pullman Community Update](https://pullmanchamber.com/live-in-pullman/pullman-community-update/) including having our own editorials.
