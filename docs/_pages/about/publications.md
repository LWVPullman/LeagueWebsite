The Pullman League of Women voters can frequently be found in the news! We do a lot of work in the community, so we pop up in the local newspaper and the Community Update. Also, the Pullman League releases our own newsletter quarterly. All of those items can be found linked below!

In 2016 the Pullman League completed a poverty study for Whitman County.  Details can be found in the [Final Poverty Study Report](https://www.lwvpullman.org/assets/PDFs/Pov_Study_Final.pdf).  A summary is available in [Poverty Study Summary](https://www.lwvpullman.org/assets/PDFs/Pov_Stdy_Exec_Summary.pdf).

The League is frequently in the [Pullman Community Update](https://pullmanchamber.com/live-in-pullman/pullman-community-update/) including having our own editorials.
