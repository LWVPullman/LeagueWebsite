All of the League's advocacy efforts are based on Positions. A Position is a statement of the League's point of view on a particular issue. It is developed after careful and thorough studies by members who try to examine the issue from all sides. The final Position statement captures general agreement among members, arrived at through discussion and consensus, on the issue.

9. **Addressing Poverty in Whitman County**:
**General Statement**:
In a two year-long study (20146-2016) the League of Women voters found that poverty is a serious issue in Whitman County affecting approximately 17 % of residents who are not university students. The LWV of Pullman strongly supports local actions to alleviate and prevent poverty in Whitman County, especially those
listed in the positions below.

a. **Resource Accessibility and Data Gathering**:
(1) Support of a uniform system which collects, updates and distributes information on services available for those in poverty in Whitman County. The League promotes participation of this system by both public and private entities.
(2) In order to provide more adequate, cost effective services that reach more of those living in poverty, the League supports the uniform gathering of data, in a form appropriate for public dissemination, on classes of individuals served and those denied service, including such data as age, inability to work due to physical and/or mental disability, general location in the county, etc.

b. **Legal issues**:
(1) Support of the establishment of a system to connect those in poverty who need affordable legal a assistance with legal services.
(2) Support the removal of interest charges on delayed court payments for fines or fees. The LWV of Pullman finds that such fees are unfair additional punishment placed on low-income offenders and often result in continuous debt or jail simply because the person cannot afford them.

c. **Food Security**: Support for improved food security for those in or near poverty in traditional and innovative ways.

d. **Housing**: Support of efforts and incentives to create more transitional and permanent housing opportunities for low-income residents. We encourage building more housing that is affordable, socially integrated, architecturally innovative and geographically distributed in towns and throughout the county. We support incentives for landlords to accept subsidized tenants.

e. **Transportation**: Support the development of a variety of county-wide transportation systems for Whitman County. It should include both on-demand and regular, dependable transportation to employment opportunities and to services.

f. **Child Care**: Support access to affordable childcare in Whitman County, with special consideration for rural and small communities. This includes adequate public and private funding, providing incentives to increase capacities, greater flexibility in rules of eligibility and support of adequate provider compensation.

g. **Elder Care**: Support basic services for the elderly, without consideration of their economic status, to avoid impoverishment in Whitman County.

h. **Education and job training**: Support improvement of education in Whitman County, including county-wide efforts to increase high school graduation rates. We also support efforts to encourage more students to take post-secondary training -- vocational, academic, professional and artistic. The League supports a Community College presence in Whitman County.

i. **Health Care**: Support measures to provide access to and the availability of affordable health care in Whitman County. This should include, but not be limited to, medical, behavioral health, and dental care, especially for residents living in poverty or having inadequate health insurance.
