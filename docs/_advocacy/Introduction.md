Introduction to League Advocacy

The League of Women Voters has an active advocacy effort at the local level, and at both the state level and national LWV organization level.  Because the League is primarily a volunteer organization, League advocacy is mostly carried out by volunteers and collaboratively with students and colleges.  Our community, State and Nation needs effort by people like you to build an improved society.

A few of the broad areas of League advocacy are:

Making Democracy Work
Fighting Climate Change and its Effects
Ensuring Social Justice
Improving Education
Establishing Fair Revenue. 

More details about each of these are available on the Washington State League website https://lwvwa.org/2021Issues    An example information on the National League website is https://www.lwv.org/expanding-voter-access/2020-election-impact-report

In each case where our League makes a public statement representing the League, it must be based on one or more studies of the issue made our League, or the State or National League and be made by our League President or a person authorized by the President.  Of course any League member may make a personal statement or write a letter representing her or his own opinion, but may not state it as a League position.

To participate in League advocacy, a member should survey the League positions, issues, and programs on the local, State, or National league websites and pick one or more areas in which you have a passion or interest.  By studying this issue further, taking or communicating with other League members working on this issue at the local or state level, opportunities for active advocacy will soon become apparent.

More information our local Leagues positions and issues are given below, and in the LWV of Pullman PRIMER at  (INSERT LINK HERE).
